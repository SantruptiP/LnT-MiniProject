## Defining Our System
In the first step the trucks arrives registration of truck will be done where security person will fill TEVIS with all required information about the supplier and the cargo then the driver receives a queue ticket . Next, calling of truck will happen where the warehouse manager will see all the registered trucks on his PC display and the indication will be displayed as follows RED : ramp is busy, GREEN: ramp is ready to accept a truck, GREY: truck is unloading. Warehouse manager enters ramp and door number and TEVIS calls the truck at the same time LED displays flashes corresponding ticket , ramp and door number followed by a gong sound information of every call is flashing on LED display. Third step is where the departing of truck will happen , after cargo is off-loaded from the truck warehouse manager enters detail in TEVIS particular truck is departed and YELLOW light is displayed in the LED display indicating the truck is leaving the logistic center, when the truck reaches to the security booth the security will enter the info and truck is departed.Last, warehouse manager will call the next truck to the ramp which is free again LED display flashes the corresponding ramp , door and ticket followed by gong sound.
